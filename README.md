# 100 Days of Code – Python Projects 🚀

This repository documents my journey through **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**.  
My goal is simple: **build 100 Python projects in 100 days** and become confident using Python professionally.

Each day focuses on learning a new concept and applying it by building a real, working project. This repo serves as both my **learning log** and **portfolio**.
