# Day 1 – Python Basics 🐍

Today was my first day learning Python.  
The goal was to understand how a program talks to the user and how data is stored.

## What I Learned

- How to print text using `print()`
- Using `\n` for new lines
- String concatenation
- Getting user input with `input()`
- Using `len()` to check the length of a string
- Variables and naming rules
- Swapping values between variables
- Basic program flow (input → process → output)

## Mini Exercises

I practiced:
- Printing multiple lines
- Greeting the user using their name
- Counting characters in a name
- Storing data in variables
- Combining strings together

## Mini Project — Band Name Generator 🎸

The program asks the user:
1. The city they grew up in
2. Their pet’s name

Then it generates a band name using those inputs.

Example:
    Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
    Which city did you grow up in?
    Paris
    What is your pet's name?
    Milo
    Your band name could be Paris Milo

## Takeaway

Today helped me understand the fundamentals of programming:
- Programs take input
- They process data
- Then produce output

Everything in programming basically follows this pattern.
