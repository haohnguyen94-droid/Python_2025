## Key Takeaway

Day 3 focused on control flow and decision-making logic in Python.

The main ideas covered were:

- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control program flow
- Understanding how condition order affects execution
- The difference between:
  - `if/elif/else` (mutually exclusive branches)
  - Nested conditionals (layered logic)
  - Multiple independent `if` statements
- Using comparison operators to evaluate conditions
- Using the modulo operator (`%`) for pattern-based checks (e.g., odd/even)
- Combining conditions with logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Updating state using variables (e.g., `bill += value`)

The key concept was learning how to structure logical decision trees clearly and predictably.

At a higher level, Day 3 was about designing structured branching logic rather than just writing sequential code.
